<h1>Sign up</h1>

<%= form_for(@user) do |f| %>		<!--Presence of do keyword indicates that the form_for helper method takes a block, which has 1 variable, which we've called f for form-->
									<!--HTML produced is: <form ="/users" class="new_user" id="new_user" method="post". 
									Rails creates the form tag using the @user object; because every Ruby object knows its own class, Rails figures out that @user is of
									class User; moreover, since @user is a NEW user Rails knows to construct a form with the post method, which is the proper verb for
									creating a new object. The class and id above are irrelevant, what's important is action="/users" and method="post". Together these
									constitute instructions to issue an HTML post request to the /users URL-->
	<%= render 'fields', :f => f %>
	<div class="actions">
		<%= f.submit "Sign up" %>
	</div>
